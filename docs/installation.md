# Installation

To use `js-docs` in your project, clone using `@pr4j3sh/frames`

```sh
npm create @pr4j3sh/frames@latest js-docs docs
```

This will clone the template and add `js-docs` in `docs` directory.

## Prerequisites

Before using `js-docs`, ensure that you have the following dependencies set up:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or later recommended)
- **npm** (comes bundled with Node.js)
